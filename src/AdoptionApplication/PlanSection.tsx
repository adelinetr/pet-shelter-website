                <p>
                    Visit our shelter during adoption hours to meet our adorable pets and spend time interacting with different animals to find the perfect match for your lifestyle. 
                    <br /><br />
                    Once you've found a potential match, our staff will provide you with an adoption application form. Complete the form, providing accurate information about your living situation, experience with pets, and preferences. Our team will then review your application to ensure that the pet you've chosen is a good fit for your home and lifestyle. We may contact you for additional information or clarification if needed.
                    <br /><br />
                    If your application is approved, you'll have the opportunity for a meet-and-greet with the pet. Spend time getting to know each other to ensure a strong connection.
